        <p>
          Every now and then I notice feats of great talent and skill, whether
          it be from those I know well to those I donâ€™t. The appreciation of
          such works fuels my passion to reach similar standards of excellence.

          <br/><br/>
          I have had the privilege of working with and learning from an
          incredible network of professionals so dedicated to their crafts with
          such humility, I find that it compels me to elevate the standards I
          hold myself to. 
          
          <br/><br/>
          
          It is of great importance for me to sharpen my skills
          and broaden my talents in the effort that I can improve myself and in
          the same breath, deliver a level of quality that others can be proud
          of for me. 
          
          <br/><br/>
          
          I believe that to aim for excellence in the face of great
          challenges and opportunities, is the mark of a designer.
